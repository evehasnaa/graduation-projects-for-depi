# 📊 Graduation Project – Supermarket Sales Data Analysis


## 👩‍💻 Junior Data Analyst | Team Project | DEPI Initiative

This project was completed as part of our **graduation requirements** and the **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI)**. Our team of junior data analysts collaborated to explore and analyze a supermarket sales dataset to gain actionable business insights.

We used **Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib** within Google Colab to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization.

## 🧠 Project Objective

To analyze supermarket sales data in order to:
- Understand customer behavior and spending patterns
- Compare branch performance and revenue
- Identify peak hours and product category performance
- Explore the relationship between customer demographics and sales

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Google Colab**
- **Excel** (initial exploration)
- **GitHub** for collaboration and documentation

## 🔍 Key Project Steps

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Checked for missing values and handled data types
- Converted date/time columns into appropriate formats
- Ensured consistency in categorical variables

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed sales distribution across branches (A, B, C)
- Compared revenue and customer types (Member vs. Normal)
- Studied payment methods and gender spending habits
- Investigated sales trends over days and times

### 3. **Data Visualization**
- Created bar charts, pie charts, and line plots using **Matplotlib**
- Visualized:
  - Top-performing branches
  - Most-used payment methods
  - Time-based trends in revenue and customer activity

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Branch C** consistently outperformed others in total sales.
- **Female customers** had slightly higher spending patterns.
- **Evening hours** recorded the highest customer traffic.
- **Ewallet** was the most common payment method.
